## **What is the purpose of this project?**
This project is my second milestone project where I have developed an interactive front end website for an electronic musician called Tourist. 
The aim of this website was to create a platform where fans of Tourist can go to keep up to date with the latest news, buy music, view upcoming gigs, 
buy tickets, get in touch with the artist and even test their knowledge of the musician with a quiz. 
The main requirements for this project were to create an interactive front end website whilst implementing all of the technologies that I have learnt 
so far on the Full Stack Software Development course. The technologies used are HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript which work together to create an intuitive interactive website.
The Bootstrap CSS library was used to create the structure of my website using the grid system, which enabled me to make the website fully responsive across a range of different 
screen sizes including mobile, tablet and desktop. The JQuery framework was also implemented in certain parts of my Javascript code.
